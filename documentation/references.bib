  abstract = {This paper presents formulation of computationally efficient models of photoionization produced by non-thermal gas discharges in air based on three-group Eddington and improved Eddington (SP3) approximations to the radiative transfer equation, and on effective representation of the classic integral model for photoionization in air developed by Zheleznyak et al (1982) by a set of three Helmholtz differential equations. The reported formulations represent extensions of ideas advanced recently by Se{\textasciiacute}gur et al (2006) and Luque et al (2007), and allow fast and accurate solution of photoionization problems at different air pressures for the range 0.1 {$<$} pO2R {$<$} 150 Torr cm, where pO2 is the partial pressure of molecular oxygen in air in units of Torr (pO2 = 150 Torr at atmospheric pressure) and R in cm is an effective geometrical size of the physical system of interest. The presented formulations can be extended to other gases and gas mixtures subject to availability of related emission, absorption and photoionization coefficients. The validity of the developed models is demonstrated by performing direct comparisons of the results from these models and results obtained from the classic integral model. Specific validation comparisons are presented for a set of artificial sources of photoionizing radiation with different Gaussian dimensions, and for a realistic problem involving development of a double-headed streamer at ground pressure. The reported results demonstrate the importance of accurate definition of the boundary conditions for the photoionization production rate for the solution of second order partial differential equations involved in the Eddington, SP3 and the Helmholtz formulations. The specific algorithms derived from the classic photoionization model of Zheleznyak et al (1982), allowing accurate calculations of boundary conditions for differential equations involved in all three new models described in this paper, are presented. It is noted that the accurate formulation of boundary conditions represents an important task needed for a successful extension of the proposed formulations to two- and three-dimensional physical systems with obstacles of complex geometry (i.e. electrodes, dust particles, aerosols, etc), which are opaque for the photoionizing UV photons.},

  abstract = {A particle code has been developed to study the distribution and acceleration of electrons in electric discharges in air. The code can follow the evolution of a discharge from the initial stage of a single free electron in a background electric field to the formation of an electron avalanche and its transition into a streamer. The code is in 2D axi-symmetric coordinates, allowing quasi 3D simulations during the initial stages of streamer formation. This is important for realistic simulations of problems where space charge fields are essential such as in streamer formation. The charged particles are followed in a Cartesian mesh and the electric field is updated with Poisson's equation from the charged particle densities. Collisional processes between electrons and air molecules are simulated with a Monte Carlo technique, according to cross section probabilities. The code also includes photoionisation processes of air molecules by photons emitted by excited constituents. The paper describes the code and presents some results of streamer development at 70 km altitude in the mesosphere where electrical discharges (sprites) are generated above severe thunderstorms and at \$10 km relevant for lightning and thundercloud electrification. The code is used to study acceleration of thermal seed electrons in streamers and to understand the conditions under which electrons may reach energies in the runaway regime. This is the first study in air, with a particle model with realistic spatial dependencies of the electrostatic field. It is shown that at 1 atm pressure the electric field must exceed \$7.5 times the breakdown field to observe runaway electrons in a constant electric field. This value is close to the field where the electric force on an electron equals the maximum frictional force on an electron -- found at \$100 eV. It is also found that this value is reached in a negative streamer tip at 10 km altitude when the background electric field equals \$3 times the breakdown field. At higher altitudes, the background electric field must be relatively larger to create a similar field in a streamer tip because of increased influence of photoionisation. It is shown that the role of photoionization increases with altitude and the effect is to decrease the space charge fields and increase the streamer propagation velocity. Finally, effects of electrons in the runaway regime on negative streamer dynamics are presented. It is shown the energetic electrons create enhanced ionization in front of negative streamers. The simulations suggest that the thermal runaway mechanism may operate at lower altitudes and be associated with lightning and thundercloud electrification while the mechanism is unlikely to be important in sprite generation at higher altitudes in the mesosphere.},
