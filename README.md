# Afivo-streamer

Afivo-streamer is a code for fluid simulations of streamer discharges. It is based on
the [afivo](https://github.com/MD-CWI/afivo) framework, which provides adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and a multigrid solver for Poisson's equation.

A brief summary of features:

* 1D, 2D, 3D and a cylindrical fluid model
* Electrodes
* Chemistry
* Gas dynamics
* OpenMP parallelization

## Documentation

Documentation is available at http://teunissen.net/afivo_streamer

## Requirements

* A unix-like system (e.g., GNU/Linux)
* Gfortran 5 or newer

## News

* The code has been moved to Github due to [these changes at gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/03/24/efficient-free-tier/)
