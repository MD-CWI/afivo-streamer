# Analyzing species production and energy efficiency

In this example, we will run a 2D axisymmetric simulation and analyze the production of varies species, as well as the energy deposited into the discharge. A config file is provided at `tutorials/species_production/air_cyl.cfg`. In this example, we focus on the production of atomic oxygen on nanosecond time scales.

## Visualizing the production

There are several [python tools](documentation/tools.md) that can help to
